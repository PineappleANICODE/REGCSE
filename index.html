            <h3><u>Life of Muhammad</u></h3>
            <s1>Muhammad is the final and one of the most important prophets in Islam. After saying his name, some Muslims may say 'Peace be upon him' (PBUH) as a sign of love and respect.
                <br>
                His life was from 570AD and 650AD and there was many important events that happened during this time.
                <ul>
                    <li>570AD: Muhammad is born in Makkah (alt spelling: Mecca) in a time where people worshiped <a>false idols</a> and Gods.</li>
                    <li>610AD: This is <a><u>The Night of Power</u></a> and Muhammad's first revalation. In a cave outside Makkah, Muhammad is visited by the <b onclick = "angeljibril()">Angel Jibril</b> who told him to 'proclaim' or 'read' three times (even though Muhammad couldn't read). <div class = "Quote">"Proclaim! In the name of thy Lord and Cherisher, who created â€“ created man, out of a [mere] clot of congealed blood. Proclaim! And thy Lord Is Most Bountiful! He who taught [the use of] the pen taught man that which he knew not."</div></li>
                    <li>612AD +: Muhammad begins to preach in Makkah as a Prophet. This made the leaders of Makkah angry.</li>
                    <li> for the next 22 years Muhammad recieves regular Revelations through the <b onclick = "angeljibril()">Angel Jibril</b> and these are compiled into the <a>Qur'an.</a></li>
                    <li>622AD: In a vision, Muhammad is taken to Jerusalem on a pegasus and then to heaven, where he meets the Prophets and Allah. He is instructed to pray 5 times a day - Muslims still do this today and it's called Salah. This journey is called The <a><u>Night Journey</u></a></li>
                    <li>622AD: Muhammad and his followers have to leave Makkah to go to Medina. Muhammad becomes the City's leader</li>
                    <li>624AD: The <a>Muslim-Quraysh</a> war begins. The Muslims won and Muhammad smashes all the statues of the false idols in the Ka'aba > ðŸ•‹</li>
                    <li>650AD: Muhammad dies.</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </s1>

            <h3><u>Sunni Muslims and Shi'a Muslims</u></h3>
            <h4>Once Muhammad died, the Muslim community was split over who should be the new leader of Islam. Some Muslims believed that a democratic vote should be held, and so Muhammad's ðŸ’—ðŸŒŸbffðŸŒŸðŸ’— Abu Bakr was voted as the new leader of these Muslims, and they are now called <a>Sunni</a>.<br> However, other Muslims believed that Muhammad's closest male blood relative should be the new leader, and hence Ali (Muhammad's cousin & son-in-law) became the new leader of these Muslims, and they called themsleves <a>Shi'a</a>

            <s2><u>Sunni Islam: 6 articles of faith</u></s2>
            <br><s3>Here we go.... I can never remember these</s3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Tawhid</b> To have faith in the oneness of God. There is only one God.</li>
                <li><b>Malakiah</b> God is too great to communicate directly with humans. Instead, he passes messages called <a>risalah</a> to his prophets via Angels. Angels are pure beings and always follow the will of God.</li>
                <li><b>Kutub</b> The holy books of Islam and the belief that the Qur'an is the unchanged word of Allah revealed to Muhammad</li>
                <li><b>Al Qadr</b> Everything in the universe is predestinated by Allah and follows his plan. Allah decides or known everything that will happen.</li>
                <li><b>Akirah</b> Life on earth is a test and after you die you will be judged by god and either go to heaven or hell</li>
                <li><b>Risalah</b> The belief in prophethood and that Allah communicated with the prophets through the angels. Phophets should be respected but never worshipped.</li>
                <br><br><div class="Quote">"Oh you who have believed, believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Book that He sent down upon His Messenger and the Scripture which He sent down before. And whoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day has certainly gone far astray."</div>
            </ol>
            </div>
            <div id = "SunniShia"><s2><u>Shia Islam: The 5 Roots of Usul Al-Din</u></s2>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Tawhid</b> I'm not writing this out again</li>
                <li><b>Adlat</b> The belief in Divine Justice and that Allah is always right and fair. Allah works beyond our understanding.</li>
                <li><b>Nubuwwah</b> Prophets should be respected. Muhammad was the final prophet and communicated the Qur'an.</li>
                <li><b>Imamate</b> The Imamate were 12 Imams who Shi'a Muslims believe were chosen by God as spiritual succesors to Muhammad to lead Islam.</li>
                <li><b>Akirah</b> The belief in Resurrection and that Muslims will be judged by God afterward.</li>
